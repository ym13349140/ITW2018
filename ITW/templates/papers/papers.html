        <h4>Author Guideline<hr></h4>
        <p>Authors are encouraged to use LaTex to prepare their manuscript that follows the <a href="http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html" target="_blank"><i>IEEE conference specifications</i></a>. Submitted manuscripts should be contained within 5 pages with font size no smaller than 10 points and reasonable margins in all sides. Page numbers should be omitted. Submitted manuscripts should provide sufficient details of the research allowing reviewers to assess the originality and authenticity of the work. If full proof cannot be accommodated within 5 pages, the authors can publicize the supplementary material which can be openly accessed, and provide the specific reference. Duplicated submission to multiple conferences is strictly forbidden, but a conference presentation of a submitted journal manuscript is allowed.</p>
