                    <p>Claude Shannon invented information theory to understand the fundamental limits of communication. Since then, it has revolutionized the communication field. The core of information theory is an approach to research based on finding the simplest model to study a problem. Although conceived and cultivated in the context of communication, this approach to research has much broader applicability. In this talk, we illustrate this using our recent work on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).</p>
                    <p>GANs is a novel approach to the age-old problem of learning a probabilistic model from data. Learning is achieved by setting up a game between a generator whose goal is to generate fake data that are close to the real data and a discriminator whose goal is to distinguish between the real and fake data. Even though many increasingly complex GANs architectures have been proposed recently, several basic issues remain unanswered: 1) what is a general way of specifying the loss function of GANs? 2) what is the limiting solution of a GAN as the amount of data increases? 3) what is the generalization ability of a GAN? 4) what is the stability of training GANs under gradient descent? We answer these questions in the simplest setting of the problem. In the process, a connection is drawn between GANs, optimal transport theory, rate-distortion theory and game theory.<span class="read-less function-span">(Read Less >>)</span></p>

                    <p>5G is designed to meet very diverse service requirements, ranging from extremely high data rate, ultra-low latency, very high reliability and massive machine type of communications with very low date. This 5G grant vision to design a system usable for many applications pose great technology challenges. The need of a new channel coding is a fundamental question to be addressed for 3GPP 5G New Radio (NR) standardization. In this talk, the design criteria and performance requirements for the code selection are discussed first by looking at the error correcting codes for 3G, 4G and 5G wireless standards. Then the talk will focus on the novel designs of NR adopted Polar code in the following areas: (1) Polar Code with universal rate matching schemes, (2) Polar Code optimization for very short code block sizes, (3) Polar code with extreme high speed decoder (4) Polar Code for blind rate detection (5) Polar Code for Hybrid ARQ, In addition, we also present the state-of-art silicon implementation for polar decoder and field trial results for the superior performance for Polar Code in the real world applications.<span class="read-less function-span">(Read Less >>)</span></p>
