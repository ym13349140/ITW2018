His research interests include information theory and network coding. He is the author of the textbooks A First Course in Information Theory (Kluwer Academic/Plenum 2002) and its revision Information Theory and Network Coding (Springer 2008), which have been adopted by over 100 institutions around the world. In spring 2014, based on his second book, he gave the first MOOC on information theory on Coursera that reached over 25,000 students. </p>
            <p>Dr. Yeung was a member of the Board of Governors of the IEEE Information Theory Society. He was General Chair of the First and the Fourth Workshops on Network, Coding, and Applications (NetCod 2005, 2008), a Technical Co-Chair for the 2006 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory, a Technical Co-Chair for the 2006 IEEE Information Theory Workshop, and a General Co-Chair of the 2015 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory. He currently serves as an Editor-at-Large of Communications in Information and Systems, an Editor of Foundation and Trends in Communications and Information Theory and of Foundation and Trends in Networking, and was an Associate Editor for Shannon Theory of the IEEE Transactions on Information Theory. </p>
            <p>He was a recipient of the Croucher Foundation Senior Research Fellowship for 2000/2001, the Best Paper Award (Communication Theory) of the 2004 International Conference on Communications, Circuits and System, the 2005 IEEE Information Theory Society Paper Award, the Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel Research Award of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation in 2007, and the 2016 IEEE Eric E. Sumner Award. In 2015, he was named an Outstanding Overseas Chinese Information Theorist by the China Information Theory Society. He is a Fellow of the IEEE, Hong Kong Academy of Engineering Sciences, and the Hong Kong Institution of Engineers. </p>
