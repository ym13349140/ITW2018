        </h2>
        <p>ITW 2018 solicits and welcomes original contributions on the frontiers of information theory, coding theory and their applications, as well as the frontiers with other fields such as data science, biology, and signal processing. The conference structure consists of a daily plenary seminar followed by two parallel sessions throughout the day.</p>
        <p>Guangzhou, the third city in mainland China and known as the "Southern Capital," is renowned for the enterprising spirit and open-mindedness of its people throughout its history of over 2,000 years. The conference attendees will have an opportunity to sample a vibrant local culture and partake of some of the best Cantonese cuisine. The conference venue is the Sun Yat-Sen University Kaifeng Hotel, located within the university campus where the attendees can explore many historic architectures and artifacts, including the famous Swacey Hall, Xing Pavilion, Scholar Archway and etc.</p>

        <p>The conference includes many opportunities for informal interaction through social events, including the welcome reception on Nov. 25th, Pearl River night cruise on Nov. 26th, banquet at the Sky No. 1 Restaurant on Nov. 27th, and an excursion to Baiyun Mountain on Nov. 28th. A pleasant surprise awaits the attendees who stay at the conference through its final day.</p>
